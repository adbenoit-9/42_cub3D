# CUB3D

"My first RayCaster with miniLibX"

## Objective

This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90’s game, which was the first FPS ever.

This project’s objectives are similar to all this first year’s objectives: Rigor, use of C, use of basic algorithms, information research etc.

As a graphic design project, cub3D will enable you to improve skills in these areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.

To conclude cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics.
